# Account ID

> [!Note]
> An immutable and unique identifier for the `Account`.

The `Account` ID is a 120-bit long number. This identifier is designed to contain the metadata of an account. The metadata includes the [account type](#account-type), [account storage mode](#account-storage-mode) and the version of the `Account`. This metadata is included in the ID to ensure it can be read without needing the full account state.

The ID is generated by hashing a randomly generated seed together with commitments to the initial code and storage of the `Account` until the resulting ID has the desired account type and storage mode. This process requires a small amount of Proof-of-Work (9 bits) that can be done even by low-powered devices. The resulting 256-bit hash is shortened to 120 bits.

Account type and storage mode are chosen at account creation time and cannot be changed later.

### Account type

There are two main categories of accounts in Miden: **basic accounts** and **faucets**.

- **Basic Accounts:**
  Basic Accounts may be either mutable or immutable:
  - *Mutable:* Code can be changed after deployment.
  - *Immutable:* Code cannot be changed once deployed.

- **Faucets:**
  Faucets are always immutable and can be specialized by the type of assets they issue:
  - *Fungible Faucet:* Can issue fungible [assets](../asset.md).
  - *Non-fungible Faucet:* Can issue non-fungible [assets](../asset.md).

### Account storage mode

Users can choose whether their accounts are stored publicly or privately. The preference is encoded in the third and fourth most significant bits of the account's [ID](#id):

- **Public Accounts:**
  The account's state is stored on-chain, similar to how accounts are stored in public blockchains like Ethereum.

- **Network `Account`s:**
  The account's state is stored on-chain, just like **public** accounts. Additionally, the network will monitor this account for any public notes targeted at it and attempt to create network transactions against the account, which consume the notes. Contracts that rely on a shared, publicly accessible state (e.g., an AMM) should be network accounts.

- **Private Accounts:**
  Only a commitment (hash) to the account's state is stored on-chain. This mode is suitable for users who prioritize privacy or plan to store a large amount of data in their `Account`. To interact with a private `Account`, a user must have knowledge of its interface.

## Encoding

An `Account` ID can be encoded in different formats:

1. [**Address**](./address.md#types--interfaces):
    - Used when sending or receiving notes or assets.
    - Used to communicate the [account interface](./code.md#interface) between sender and receiver.

2. **Hexadecimal**:
   - Example: `0xd345c9766a2d5e606477a5676b049a`
   - Frequently used encoding for blockchain addresses
   - Used to identify accounts in command-line interfaces or explorers.
