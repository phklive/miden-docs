# Miden client

The Miden client currently has three main components:

1. [Miden client library](#miden-client-library).
2. [Miden client CLI](#miden-client-cli).
3. [Miden web client](#miden-web-client).

### Miden client library

The Miden client library is a Rust library that can be integrated into projects, allowing developers to interact with the Miden rollup.

The library provides a set of APIs and functions for executing transactions, generating proofs, and managing activity on the Miden network.

### Miden client CLI

The Miden client also includes a command-line interface (CLI) that serves as a wrapper around the library, exposing its basic functionality in a user-friendly manner.

The CLI provides commands for interacting with the Miden rollup, such as submitting transactions, syncing with the network, and managing account data.

More information about the CLI can be found in the [CLI section](./rust-client/cli).

### Miden web client

The Miden web client is a web-based interface that allows users to interact with the Miden rollup through a browser. It wraps most of the functionality of the Rust library and provides a user-friendly interface for managing accounts, submitting transactions, and monitoring activity on the network.
