title: Config
---

After [installation](../install-and-run.md#install-the-client), use the client by running the following and adding the [relevant commands](index.md#commands):

```sh
miden-client
```

:::tip
Run `miden-client --help` for information on `miden` commands.
:::

## Client Configuration

We configure the client using a [TOML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML) file ([`miden-client.toml`]). The file gets created when running `miden-client init`. It can also be edited to use a different configuration for the client. Running this command is optional, but can be done if you want to have more fine-grained control over the configuration of the `miden-client`.

```sh
store_filepath = "store.sqlite3"
secret_keys_directory = "keystore"
default_account_id = "0x012345678"
token_symbol_map_filepath = "token_symbol_map.toml"
remote_prover_endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"
package_directory         = "./packages"
max_block_number_delta = 256

[rpc]
endpoint = { protocol = "http", host = "localhost", port = 57291 }
timeout_ms = 10000

[note-transport] # optional
endpoint = "http://localhost:57292"
timeout_ms = 10000
```

The TOML file should reside in same the directory from which you run the CLI.

### RPC

An `rpc` section is used to configure the connection to the Miden node. It contains the following fields:

- `endpoint`: The endpoint of the Miden node. It can be a specific url (like `"https://rpc.devnet.miden.io"`) or a table with the following fields:
  - `protocol`: The protocol used to connect to the node. It can be either `http` or `https`.
  - `host`: The host of the node. It can be either an IP address or a domain name.
  - `port`: The port of the node. It is an integer.

This field can be set with the `--network` flag when running the `miden-client init` command. For example, to set the testnet endpoint, you can run: `miden-client init --network testnet`.

:::note

- Running the node locally for development is encouraged.
- However, the endpoint can point to any remote node.

### Store and keystore

The `store_filepath` field is used to configure the path to the SQLite database file used by the client. The `secret_keys_directory` field is used to configure the path to the directory where the keystore files are stored. The default values are `store.sqlite3` and `keystore`, respectively.

The store filepath can be set when running the `miden-client init` command with the `--store-path` flag.

### Default account ID

The `default_account_id` field contains the default account ID to be used by the client's command when no `account` is provided. It is a hexadecimal string that represents the account ID. The field is optional, and if not set, the client will set it once the first account is created.

By default none is set, but you can set and unset it with:

```sh
miden-client account --default <ACCOUNT_ID> #Sets default account
miden-client account --default none #Unsets default account
```

:::note
The account must be tracked by the client in order to be set as the default account.
:::

You can also see the current default account ID with:

```sh
miden-client account --default
```

### Token symbol map

The `token_symbol_map_filepath` field is used to configure the path to the TOML file that contains the token symbol map. The token symbol map stores the faucet details for different token symbols. The default value is `token_symbol_map.toml`.

This file must be updated manually with known token symbol mappings. A sample token symbol map file looks like this:

```toml
# This addresses in this file are not real and are only for demonstration purposes.
ETH = { id = "0xa031cc137adecd54", decimals = 18 }
BTC = { id = "0x2f3c4b5e6a7b8c9d", decimals = 8 }
```

The `id` field is the faucet account ID and the `decimals` field is the number of decimals used by the token.

When the client is configured with a token symbol map, any transaction command that specifies an asset can use the token symbol instead of the asset ID. For example, when specifying an asset normally you would use something like:
`1::0x2f3c4b5e6a7b8c9d`

But if the faucet is included in the token symbol map (using the sample above as the mapping), you would use:
`0.00000001::BTC`

Notice how the amount specified when using the token symbol takes into account the decimals of the token (`1` base unit of the token is `0.00000001` for BTC as it uses 8 decimals).

### Remote prover endpoint

The `remote_prover_endpoint` field is used to configure the usage of a remote prover. You can set a remote prover when calling the `miden-client prover` command with the `--remote-prover-endpoint` flag. The prover will be used for all transactions that are executed with the `miden` command. By default, no remote prover is used and all transactions are executed locally.

### Package directory
`Packages` are Miden's native packaging format.
This structure contains the outputs of a compiled project, with all of its corresponding metadata. Specifically, a `Package` may contain the compiled MAST for an `Account Component` in the form of a `Library`.

The `package_directory` field is used to configure the path to the directory where the account components are stored in package (`.masp`) form. The default value is `./packages`.

In this directory you can place the packages used to create the account components. These define the interface of the account that will be created.

For more information on miden packages, see:
- [The mast-package crate](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/blob/next/crates/mast-package/README.md)
- [The Miden package's status article on the Miden compiler](https://0xmiden.github.io/compiler/appendix/known-limitations.html#packaging)

### Block Delta

The `max_block_number_delta` is an optional field that is used to configure the maximum number of blocks the client can be behind the network.

If not set, the default behavior is to ignore the block difference between the client and the network. If set, the client will check this difference is within the specified maximum when validating a transaction.

```sh
miden-client init --block-delta 256
```

### Environment variables

- `MIDEN_DEBUG`: When set to `true`, enables debug mode on the transaction executor and the script compiler. For any script that has been compiled and executed in this mode, debug logs will be output in order to facilitate MASM debugging ([these instructions](https://0xMiden.github.io/miden-vm/user_docs/assembly/debugging.html) can be used to do so). This variable can be overridden by the `--debug` CLI flag.

### Note Transport

A `note-transport` section is used to configure the connection to the Miden Note Transport node used in the exchange of private notes. It contains the following fields:
- `endpoint`: The endpoint of the Miden Note Transport node;
- `timeout-ms`: The timeout employed in client requests to the node.

> [!Note]
> - Running the node locally for development is encouraged.
> - However, the endpoint can point to any remote node.
