# RPC client

The RPC client is a separate component that allows direct interaction with a Miden node via its RPC interface. This is useful for advanced users who need to query for specific blockchain data.

```typescript
import { Endpoint, RpcClient, NoteId } from "@demox-labs/miden-sdk";

try {
  // Create the RPC client. NOTE: this assumes the node is running on localhost
  const endpoint = new Endpoint("http://localhost:57291");
  const rpcClient = new RpcClient(endpoint);

  // Query the node
  const noteId = NoteId.fromHex(_consumedNoteId);
  const fetchedNotes = await rpcClient.getNotesById([noteId]);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred while using the RPC client:", error.message);
}
```
