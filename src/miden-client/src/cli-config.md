After [installation](./install-and-run.md#install-the-client), use the client by running the following and adding the [relevant commands](cli-reference.md#commands):

```sh
miden
```

> [!Tip]
> Run `miden --help` for information on `miden` commands.

## Client Configuration

We configure the client using a [TOML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML) file ([`miden-client.toml`]).  The file gets created when running `miden init`. It can also be edited to use a different configuration for the client.

```sh
store_filepath = "store.sqlite3"
secret_keys_directory = "keystore"
default_account_id = "0x012345678"
token_symbol_map_filepath = "token_symbol_map.toml"
remote_prover_endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"
component_template_directory = "./templates"
max_block_number_delta = 256

[rpc]
endpoint = { protocol = "http", host = "localhost", port = 57291 }
timeout_ms = 10000
```

The TOML file should reside in same the directory from which you run the CLI.

### RPC

An `rpc` section is used to configure the connection to the Miden node. It contains the following fields:
- `endpoint`: The endpoint of the Miden node. It can be a specific url (like `"https://rpc.devnet.miden.io"`) or a table with the following fields:
  - `protocol`: The protocol used to connect to the node. It can be either `http` or `https`.
  - `host`: The host of the node. It can be either an IP address or a domain name.
  - `port`: The port of the node. It is an integer.

This field can be set with the `--network` flag when running the `miden init` command. For example, to set the testnet endpoint, you can run: `miden init --network testnet`.

> [!Note]
> - Running the node locally for development is encouraged.
> - However, the endpoint can point to any remote node.

### Store and keystore
The `store_filepath` field is used to configure the path to the SQLite database file used by the client. The `secret_keys_directory` field is used to configure the path to the directory where the keystore files are stored. The default values are `store.sqlite3` and `keystore`, respectively.

The store filepath can be set when running the `miden init` command with the `--store-path` flag.

### Default account ID

The `default_account_id` field contains the default account ID to be used by the client's command when no `account` is provided. It is a hexadecimal string that represents the account ID. The field is optional, and if not set, the client will set it once the first account is created.

By default none is set, but you can set and unset it with:

```sh
miden account --default <ACCOUNT_ID> #Sets default account
miden account --default none #Unsets default account
```
> [!Note]
> The account must be tracked by the client in order to be set as the default account.

You can also see the current default account ID with:

```sh
miden account --default
```
### Token symbol map
The `token_symbol_map_filepath` field is used to configure the path to the TOML file that contains the token symbol map. The token symbol map stores the faucet details for different token symbols. The default value is `token_symbol_map.toml`.

This file must be updated manually with known token symbol mappings. A sample token symbol map file looks like this:
```toml
# This addresses in this file are not real and are only for demonstration purposes.
ETH = { id = "0xa031cc137adecd54", decimals = 18 }
BTC = { id = "0x2f3c4b5e6a7b8c9d", decimals = 8 }
```

The `id` field is the faucet account ID and the `decimals` field is the number of decimals used by the token.

When the client is configured with a token symbol map, any transaction command that specifies an asset can use the token symbol instead of the asset ID. For example, when specifying an asset normally you would use something like:
```1::0x2f3c4b5e6a7b8c9d```

But if the faucet is included in the token symbol map (using the sample above as the mapping), you would use:
```0.00000001::BTC```

Notice how the amount specified when using the token symbol takes into account the decimals of the token (`1` base unit of the token is `0.00000001` for BTC as it uses 8 decimals).

### Remote prover endpoint
The `remote_prover_endpoint` field is used to configure the usage of a remote prover. You can set a remote prover when calling the `miden prover` command with the `--remote-prover-endpoint` flag. The prover will be used for all transactions that are executed with the `miden` command. By default, no remote prover is used and all transactions are executed locally.

### Component template directory
The `component_template_directory` field is used to configure the path to the directory where the account component templates are stored. The default value is `./templates`.

In this directory you can place the templates used to create the account components. These templates define the interface of the account that will be created.

A sample template file looks like this:
```toml
name = "basic_fungible_faucet"
description = ""
version = "0.1.0"
supported-types = ["FungibleFaucet"]

[[storage]]
name = "token_metadata"
description = "Contains metadata about the token associated to the faucet account"
slot = 0
value = [
    { name = "max_supply", type = "felt", description = "Maximum supply of the token in base units" },
    { name = "decimals",type = "u8", description = "Number of decimal places" },
    { name = "ticker", type = "token_symbol", description = "Token symbol of the faucet's asset, limited to 4 characters." }, 
    { value = "0" },
]
```

### Block Delta
The `max_block_number_delta` is an optional field that is used to configure the maximum number of blocks the client can be behind the network.

If not set, the default behavior is to ignore the block difference between the client and the network. If set, the client will check this difference is within the specified maximum when validating a transaction.

```sh
miden init --block-delta 256
```

### Environment variables

- `MIDEN_DEBUG`: When set to `true`, enables debug mode on the transaction executor and the script compiler. For any script that has been compiled and executed in this mode, debug logs will be output in order to facilitate MASM debugging ([these instructions](https://0xMiden.github.io/miden-vm/user_docs/assembly/debugging.html) can be used to do so). This variable can be overridden by the `--debug` CLI flag.
