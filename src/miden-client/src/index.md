# Overview

## Components

The Miden client currently has two main components:

1. [Miden client library](#miden-client-library).
2. [Miden client CLI](#miden-client-cli).

### Miden client library

The Miden client library is a Rust library that can be integrated into projects, allowing developers to interact with the Miden rollup. 

The library provides a set of APIs and functions for executing transactions, generating proofs, and managing activity on the Miden network.

### Miden client CLI 

The Miden client also includes a command-line interface (CLI) that serves as a wrapper around the library, exposing its basic functionality in a user-friendly manner. 

The CLI provides commands for interacting with the Miden rollup, such as submitting transactions, syncing with the network, and managing account data.
