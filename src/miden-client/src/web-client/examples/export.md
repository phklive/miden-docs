# Exporting Data with the Miden SDK

This guide demonstrates how to export notes and store data using the Miden SDK. We'll cover different ways to export notes with varying levels of detail and how to export the entire store.

## Exporting Notes

You can export a note with different levels of detail using the `exportNoteFile` method:

```typescript
import { WebClient } from "@demox-labs/miden-sdk";

try {
    // Initialize the web client
    const webClient = await WebClient.createClient();

    // Export a note with just its ID
    const noteIdExport = await webClient.exportNoteFile("0x1234...", "Id");
    console.log("Note ID Export:", noteIdExport);

    // Export a note with full details including inclusion proof
    const fullNoteExport = await webClient.exportNoteFile("0x1234...", "Full");
    console.log("Full Note Export:", fullNoteExport);

    // Export a note with partial details (default if type is not specified)
    const partialNoteExport = await webClient.exportNoteFile("0x1234...", "Partial");
    console.log("Partial Note Export:", partialNoteExport);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to export note:", error.message);
}
```

The export types are:
- `Id`: Exports only the note ID (only works for public notes)
- `Full`: Exports the complete note with its inclusion proof (requires the note to have an inclusion proof)
- `Partial`: Exports note details including metadata and the block number after which it was created

## Exporting Accounts

You can export an account using the `exportAccountFile` method:

```typescript
import { WebClient } from "@demox-labs/miden-sdk";

try {
    // Initialize the web client
    const webClient = await WebClient.createClient();

    // Export an account
    const accountFileExport = await webClient.exportAccountFile("0x5678...");
    console.log("Account file exported:", accountFileExport);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to export account:", error.message);
}
```

Account files include all the relevant information about the account, primarily its full state and code, but also its seed (if new) and its tracked secret keys.

## Exporting the Store

To export the entire store:

```typescript
import { WebClient } from "@demox-labs/miden-sdk";

try {
    // Initialize the web client
    const webClient = await WebClient.createClient();

    const storeExport = await webClient.exportStore();
    console.log("Store Export:", storeExport);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to export store:", error.message);
}
```

The store export contains all the data managed by the client, which can be useful for backup or migration purposes.

## Relevant Documentation

For more detailed information about the export functionality, refer to the following API documentation:

- [WebClient](docs/src/web-client/api/classes/WebClient.md) - Main client class for interacting with the Miden network

For a complete list of available classes and utilities, see the [SDK API Reference](docs/src/web-client/api/README.md).
