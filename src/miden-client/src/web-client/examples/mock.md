# Working with the mocked web client

The mock web client is useful for testing and development purposes, as it simulates interactions with the Miden blockchain without requiring a live network connection. This allows you to experiment with account creation, transaction execution, and note management in a controlled, faster environment.

The mock web client mimics the normal `WebClient` interface to allow for seamless integration with existing code, the only difference is the addition of a `proveBlock` function. The simulated environment will not create blocks automatically, so `proveBlock` needs to be called manually each time a new block should be created.

```typescript
import { MockWebClient } from "@demox-labs/miden-sdk";

try {
    // Initialize the mock web client
    const mockWebClient = await MockWebClient.createClient();

    // Running a mint transaction (assuming the client was setup previously)
    const mintTransactionResult = await mockWebClient.newTransaction(
      faucetAccount.id(),
      mintTransactionRequest
    );

    await mockWebClient.submitTransaction(mintTransactionResult);
    await mockWebClient.proveBlock(); // Creates a new block that will include the submitted transaction
    await mockWebClient.syncState();

} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred while using the mock web client:", error.message);
}
```
