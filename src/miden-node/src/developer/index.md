# Developer Guide

Welcome to the developer guide for the `miden` node :)

This is intended to serve as a basic introduction to the codebase as well as covering relevant concepts and recording
architectural decisions.

This is _not_ intended for dApp developers or users of the node, but for development of the node itself.

It is also a good idea to familiarise yourself with the [operator manual](../operator/index.md).

Living documents go stale - the code is the final arbitrator of truth.

If you encounter any outdated, incorrect or misleading information, please
